<a name="vigilvenus"></a><h2>THE VIGIL OF VENUS</h2>
<br />

<p>The <i>Pervigilium Veneris</i>&mdash;of unknown authorship, but clearly belonging
to the late literature of the Roman Empire&mdash;has survived in two MSS.,
both preserved at Paris in the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale</i>.</p>

<p>Of these two MSS. the better written may be assigned (at earliest) to
the close of the seventh century; the other (again at earliest) to the
close of the ninth. Both are corrupt; the work of two illiterate
copyists who&mdash;strange to say&mdash;were both smatterers enough to betray
their little knowledge by converting <i>Pervigilium</i> into <i>Per Virgilium</i>
(<i>scilicet</i>, &quot;by Virgil&quot;): thus helping us to follow the process of
thought by which the Middle Ages turned Virgil into a wizard. Here and
there the texts become quite silly, separately or in consent; and just
where they agree in the most surprising way&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the arrangement
of the lines&mdash;the conjectural emendator is invited to do his worst by a
note at the head of the older Codex, &quot;Sunt vero versus xxii&quot;&mdash;&quot;There are
rightly twenty-two lines.&quot;</p>

<p>This has started much ingenious guess-work. But no really convincing
rearrangement has been achieved as yet; and I have been content to take
the text pretty well as it stands, with a few corrections upon which
most scholars agree. With a poem of &quot;paratactic structure&quot; the best of
us may easily go astray by transposing lines, or blocks of lines, to
correspond with <i>our</i> sequence of thought; and I shall be content if,
following the only texts to which appeal can be made,[1] my translation
be generally intelligible.</p>

<p>It runs pretty closely, line for line, with the original; because one
may love and emulate classical terseness even while despairing to rival
it. But it does not attempt to be literal; for even were it worth doing,
I doubt if it be possible for anyone in our day to hit precisely the
note intended by an author or heard by a reader in the eighth century.
Men change subtly as nations succeed to nations, religions to religions,
philosophies to philosophies; and it is a property of immortal poetry to
shift its appeal. It does not live by continuing to mean the some thing.
It grows as we grow. We smile, for instance, when some interlocutor in a
dialogue of Plato takes a line from the <i>Iliad</i> and applies it seriously
<i>au pied de la lettre</i>. We can hardly conceive what the great line
conveyed to him; but it may mean something equally serious to us, though
in a different way.</p>

<p>[1] Facsimiles of the two Codices can be studied in a careful edition of
the <i>Pervigilum</i> by Mr Cecil Clementi, published by Mr B.H. Blackwell of
Oxford, 1911.</p>

<p><i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet</i>.<br />
Ver novum, ver jam canorurn, vere natus orbis est;<br />
Vere concordant amores, vere nubunt alites,<br />
Et nemus comam resolvit de maritis imbribus.<br />
Cras amorum copulatrix inter umbras arborum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
Inplicat casas virentes de flagello myrteo:<br />
Cras Dione jura dicit fulta sublimi throno.<br />
<i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p><i>To-morrow&mdash;What news of to-morrow?<br />
Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew</i>!<br />
It is Spring, it is chorussing Spring; 'tis the birthday of Earth, and for you!<br />
It is Spring; and the Loves and the birds wing together and woo to accord<br />
Where the bough to the rain has unbraided her locks as a bride to her lord.<br />
For she walks&mdash;she our Lady, our Mistress of Wedlock&mdash;the woodlands atween,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5<br />
And the bride-bed she weaves them, with myrtle enlacing, with curtains of green.<br />
Look aloft! list the law of Dione, sublime and enthroned in the blue:<br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew</i>!</p><br />
<br />
<p>Tunc liquore de superno spumeo et ponti globo,<br />
C&aelig;rulas inter catervas, inter et bipedes equos,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br />
Fecit undantem Dionen de maritis imbribus.<br />
<i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quiqiie amavit cras amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Ipsa gemmis purpurantem pingit annum floribus,<br />
Ipsa surgentes papillas de Favoni spiritu<br />
Urget in toros tepentes; ipsa roris lucidi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br />
Noctis aura quem relinquit, spargit umentes aquas.<br />
Et micant lacrim&aelig; trementes de caduco pondere:</p><br />
<br />
<p>Time was that a rain-cloud begat her, impregning the heave of the deep,<br />
'Twixt hooves of sea-horses a-scatter, stampeding the dolphins as sheep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10<br />
Lo! arose of that bridal Dione, rainbow'd and besprent of its dew!<br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew</i>!</p><br />
<br />
<p>She, she, with her gem-dripping finger enamels the wreath of the year;<br />
She, she, when the maid-bud is nubile and swelling winds&mdash;whispers anear,<br />
Disguising her voice in the Zephyr's&mdash;&quot;So secret the bed! And thou shy?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15<br />
She, she, thro' the hush'd humid Midsummer night draws the dew from on high;<br />
Dew bright with the tears of its origin, dew with its weight on the bough,</p><br />
<br />
<p>Gutta pr&aelig;ceps orbe parvo sustinet casus suos.<br />
En, pudorem florulent&aelig; prodiderunt purpur&aelig;:<br />
Umor ille quern serenis astra rorant noctibus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br />
Mane virgineas papillas solvit umenti peplo.<br />
Ipsa jussit mane ut udas virgines nubant ros&aelig;;<br />
Fusa Paphies de cruore deque Amoris osculis<br />
Deque gemmis deque flammis deque solis purpuris,<br />
Cras ruborem qui latebat veste tectus ignea&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25<br />
Unico marita nodo non pudebit solvere.<br />
<i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Misdoubting and clinging and trembling&mdash;&quot;Now, now must I fall? Is it now?&quot;<br />
Star-fleck'd on the stem of the brier as it gathers and falters and flows,<br />
Lo! its trail runs a ripple of fire on the nipple it bids be a rose,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20<br />
Yet englobes it diaphanous, veil upon veil in a tiffany drawn<br />
To bedrape the small virginal breasts yet unripe for the spousal of dawn;<br />
Till the vein'd very vermeil of Venus, till Cupid's incarnadine kiss,<br />
Till the ray of the ruby, the sunrise, ensanguine the bath of her bliss;<br />
Till the wimple her bosom uncover, a tissue of fire to the view,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25<br />
And the zone o'er the wrists of the lover slip down as they reach to undo.<br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew</i>!</p><br />
<br />
<p>Ipsa nymphas diva luco jussit ire myrteo:<br />
It puer comes puellis. Nee tamen credi potest<br />
Esse Amorem feriatum, si sagittas vexerit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30<br />
Ite, nymph&aelig;, posuit arma, feriatus est Amor;<br />
Jussus est inermis ire, nudus ire jussus est,<br />
Neu quid arcu, neu sagitta, neu quid igne I&aelig;deret;<br />
Sed tamen nymphse cavete, quod Cupido pulcher est;<br />
Est in armis totus idem quando nudus est Amor!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35</p><br />
<br />
<p><i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit eras amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Conpari Venus pudore mittit ad te virgines:</p><br />
<br />
<p>&quot;Go, maidens,&quot; Our Lady commands, &quot;while the myrtle is green in the groves,<br />
Take the Boy to your escort.&quot; &quot;But ah!&quot; cry the maidens, &quot;what trust is in Love's<br />
Keeping holiday too, while he weareth his archery, tools of his trade?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30<br />
&quot;Go! he lays them aside, an apprentice released; ye may wend unafraid.<br />
See, I bid him disarm, he disarms; mother-naked I bid him to go,<br />
And he goes mother-naked. What flame can he shoot without arrow or bow?&quot;<br />
Yet beware ye of Cupid, ye maidens! Beware most of all when he charms<br />
As a child: for the more he runs naked, the more he's a strong man-at-arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35</p><br />
<br />
<p><i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew!<br />
&quot;Lady Dian&quot;&mdash;Behold how demurely the damsels approach her and sue&mdash;</i>
</p>
<p>Una res est quam rogamus: cede, virgo Delia,<br />
Ut nemus sit incruentum de ferinis stragibus.<br />
Ipsa vellet ut venires, si deceret virginem:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40<br />
Jam tribus choros videres feriatos noctibus<br />
Congreges inter catervas ire per saltus tuos,<br />
Floreas inter coronas, myrteas inter casas:<br />
Nee Ceres nee Bacchus absunt, nee poetarum Deus;<br />
De tenente tota nox est pervigilia canticis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45<br />
Regnet in silvis Dione; tu recede, Delia.<br />
<i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Hear Venus her only petition! Dear maiden of<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">Delos, depart!</span><br /><br />
Let the forest be bloodless to-day, unmolested the<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">roe and the hart!</span><br /><br />
Holy huntress, thyself she would bid be her guest,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">could thy chastity stoop</span><br /><br />
To approve of our revels, our dances&mdash;three<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">nights that we weave in a troop</span><br /><br />
Arm-in-arm thro' thy sanctu'ries whirling, till faint<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">and dispersed in the grove</span><br /><br />
We lie with thy lilies for chaplets, thy myrtles for<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">arbours of love:</span><br /><br />
And Apollo, with Ceres and Bacchus to chorus&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">song, harvest, and wine&mdash;</span><br /><br />
Hymns thee dispossess'd, &quot;'Tis Dione who reigns!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">Let Diana resign!&quot;</span><br /><br />
O, the wonderful nights of Dione! dark bough,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">with her star shining thro'!</span><br /><br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">loved, love anew!</span></i>
</p>
<p>Jussit Hybl&aelig;is tribunal stare diva floribus;<br />
Pr&aelig;ses ipsa jura dicit, adsederunt Grati&aelig;.<br />
Hybla, totos funde floras quidquid annus adtulit;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50<br />
Hybla, florum rumpe vestem quantus &AElig;tn&aelig; campus est.</p>
<p>Ruris hic erunt puell&aelig;, vel puell&aelig; montium,<br />
Qu&aelig;que silvas, qu&aelig;que lucos, qu&aelig;que fontes incolunt:</p><br />
<br />
<p>Jussit omnes adsidere mater alitis dei,<br />
Jussit et nudo puellas nil Amori credere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55</p><br />
<br />
<p><i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras amet.</i><br />
She has set up her court, has Our Lady, in Hybla,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">and deckt it with blooms:&mdash;</span><br /><br />
With the Graces at hand for assessors Dione dispenses<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">her dooms.</span><br /><br />
Now burgeon, O Hybla! put forth and abound, till&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Proserpina's field,</span><br /><br />
To the foison thy lap overflowing its laurel of Sicily<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">yield.</span><br /><br />
Call, assemble the nymphs&mdash;hamadryad and dryad&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">the echoes who court</span><br /><br />
From the rock, who the rushes inhabit, in ripples<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">who swim and disport.</span><br /><br />
&quot;I admonish you maids&mdash;I, his mother, who suckled<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">the scamp ere he flew&mdash;</span><br /><br />
An ye trust to the Boy flying naked, some pestilent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 55<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">prank ye shall rue.&quot;</span><br /><br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have<br />

<p>Et rigentibus virentes ducit umbras floribus:<br />
Cras erit quum primus &AElig;ther copulavit nuptias,<br />
Et pater totum creavit vernis annum nubibus,<br />
In sinum maritus imber fluxit alm&aelig; conjugis,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60<br />
Unde fetus mixtus omnes aleret magno corpore.<br />
Ipsa venas atque mentem permeanti spiritu<br />

Perque coelum, perque terras, perque pontum<br />

<p>She has coax'd her the shade of the hazel to cover<br />

Since the day the Great Father begat it, descending<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">in streams upon Earth;</span><br /><br />
When the Seasons were hid in his loins, and the<br />

To receive in the searching and genital shower the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 60<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">soft secret of life.</span><br /><br />
As the terrible thighs drew it down, and conceived,<br />

Thoro' blood, thoro' brain, and the Mother gave all<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">to the making of man,</span><br /><br />
She, she, our Dione, directed the seminal current to<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">creep,</span><br /><br />
Penetrating, possessing, by devious paths all the<br />

She, of all procreation procuress, the share to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65<br />

Ipsa Laurentem puellam conjugem nato dedit;<br />
Moxque Marti de sacello dat pudicam virginem;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70<br />
Romuleas ipsa fecit cum Sabinis nuptias,<br />

<p>She, she, to the womb drave the knowledge, and open'd the ecstasy through.<br />
<i>Now learn ye to love who loved never&mdash;now ye who have loved, love anew!</i></p><br />
<br />
<p>Her favour it was fill'd the sail of the Trojan for Latium bound;<br />
Her favour that won her Aeneas a bride on Laurentian ground,<br />
And anon from the cloister inveigled the Virgin, the Vestal, to Mars;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 70<br />
As her wit by the wild Sabine rape recreated her Rome for its wars,<br />
With the Ramnes, Quirites, together ancestrally proud as they drew<br />
From Romulus down to our Caesar&mdash;last, best of that bone, of that thew.<br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">the pang, of his joy.</span><br /><br />
In a field was Dione in labour delivered of Cupid the<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">Boy;</span><br /><br />
And the field in its fostering lap from her travail<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">received him: he drew</span><br /><br />
Mother's milk from the delicate kisses of flowers;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">and he prosper'd and grew--</span><br /><br />

Or behear ye the sheep, to the husbanding rams<br />

<p>
Jam loquaces ore rauco stagna cycni perstrepunt;<br />
Adsonat Terei puella subter umbram populi,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 85<br />
Ut putes motus amoris ore dici musico,<br />
Et neges queri sororem de marito barbaro.<br />
Ilia cantat, nos tacemus. Quando ver venit meum?<br />
Quando fiam uti chelidon, ut tacere desinam?<br />
Perdidi Musam tacendo, nec me Apollo respicit;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90<br />
Sic Amyclas, cum tacerent, perdidit silentium.<br />
<i>Cras amet qui nunquam amavit; quique amavit cras<br />
amet</i>.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Be it harsh as the swannery's clamour that shatters the hush of the lake,<br />
Be it dulcet as where Philomela holds darkling the poplar awake,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 85<br />
So melting her soul into music, you'd vow 'twas her passion, her own,<br />
She plaineth&mdash;her sister forgot, with the Daulian crime long-agone.<br />
Hark! Hush! Draw around to the circle ... Ah, loitering Summer! Say when<br />
For me shall be broken the charm, that I chirp with the swallow again?<br />
I am old; I am dumb; I have waited to sing till Apollo withdrew&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 90<br />
So Amyclae a moment was mute, and for ever a wilderness grew.<br />

<h2>THE REGENT</h2>

<p><strong>SCENE</strong>.&mdash;&mdash;<i>A terraced courtyard before the Ducal Palace.
Porch and entrance of Chapel, R. A semicircular
balcony, L., with balustrade and marble seats, and an
opening whence a flight of steps leads down to the
city. The city lies out of sight below the terrace;
from which, between its cypresses and statuary, is
seen a straight stretch of a canal; beyond the canal are
sand-hills and the line of the open sea. Mountains,
L., dip down to the sea and form a curve of the
coast.</i></p>

<p><i>As the curtain rises, a crowd of town and country
folk is being herded to the back of the terrace by the
Ducal Guard, under Cesario. Within the Chapel, to</i>
<i>the sound of an organ, boys' voices are chanting the
service of the Mass.</i></p>

<p><i>Cesario, Gamba the Fool, Guards, Populace.</i></p>
<br />

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Way there! Give room! The Regent comes from Mass.
Guards, butt them on the toes&mdash;way there! give room!
Prick me that laggard's leg-importunate fools!</p>

<p><i>Guards.</i> Room for the Regent! Room!</p>

<p>[<i>The sacring bell rings within the Chapel.</i></p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Hark there, the bell!</p>

<p>[<i>A pause. Men of the crowd take off their caps.</i></p>

<p>Could ye not leave, this day of all the year,
Your silly suits, petitions, quarrels, pleas?
Could ye not leave, this once in seven years,
Our Lady to come holy-quiet from Mass.
Lean on the wall, and loose her cage-bird heart,
To lift and breast and dance upon the breeze.
Draws home her lord the Duke?</p>

<p><i>Crowd.</i> Long live the Duke!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> The devil, then! Why darken his approach?</p>
<br />

<p><i>Gamba (from the bench where he has been mending his
viol).</i> Because, Captain, 'tis a property knaves
and fools have in common&mdash;to stand in their own
light, as 'tis of soldiers to talk bad logic. That
knave, now&mdash;he with the red nose and the black
eye&mdash;the Duke's colours, loyal man!&mdash;you clap
an iron on his leg, and ask him why he is not
down in the city, hanging them out of window!
Go to: you are a soldier!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> And you a Fool, and on your own showing
stand in your own light.</p>

<p><i>Gamba.</i> Nay, neither in my own light, nor as a
Fool. So should myself stand between the sun
and my shadow; whereas I am not myself&mdash;these
seven years have I been but the shadow of a
Fool. Yet one must tune up for the Duke</p>

<p><i>(Strikes his viol and sings.)</i></p>

<p>&quot;Bird of the South, my Rondinello----&quot;</p>

<p>Flat-Flat!</p>
<br />

<p><i>Cesario (calling up to watchman on the Chapel roof).</i> Ho there! What news?</p>

<p><i>A Voice.</i>               Captain, no sail!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i>                                 Where sits
The wind?</p>

<p><i>Voice.</i>    Nor' west, and north a point!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i>                                Perchance
They have down'd sail and creep around the flats.</p>

<p><i>Gamba (tuning his viol).</i> Flats, flats! the straight horizon, and the life
These seven years laid by rule!  The curst canal
Drawn level through the drawn-out level sand
And thistle-tufts that stink as soon as pluck'd!
Give me the hot crag and the dancing heat,
Give me the Abruzzi, and the cushioned thyme&mdash;
Brooks at my feet, high glittering snows above.
What were thy music, viol, without a ridge?</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>Noise of commotion in the city below.</i></p>
<br />

<p><i>Cesario</i>. Watchman, what news?</p>

<p><i>A Voice</i>.                    Sir, on the sea no sail!</p>

<p><i>One of the Crowd</i>. But through the town below a horseman spurs&mdash;
I think, Count Lucio! Yes&mdash;Count Lucio!
He nears, draws rein, dismounts!</p>

<p><i>Cesario</i>.                  Sure, he brings news.</p>
<br />

<p><i>Gamba</i>. I think he brings word the Duke is sick;
his loyal folk have drunk so much of his
health.</p>

<p>[<i>A murmur has been growing in the town below. It
breaks into cheers as Count Lucio comes springing
up to the terrace.</i></p>

<p><i>Enter Lucio.</i></p>
<br />

<p><i>Lucio.</i> News! Where's the Regent? Eh? is Mass not said?
Cesario, news! I rode across the dunes;
A pilot&mdash;Nestore&mdash;you know the man&mdash;
Came panting. Sixteen sail beyond the point!
That's not a galley lost!</p>

<p><i>Crowd.</i>            Long live the Duke!</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Hark to the tocsin!  I have carried fire&mdash;
Wildfire! Why, where's my sister? I've a mind&mdash;</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>He strides towards the door of the Chapel; but
pauses at the sound of chanting within, and
comes back to Cesario.</i></p>
<br />

<p>Man, are you mute? I say the town's aflame
Below! But here, up here, you stand and stare
Like prisoners loosed to daylight. Rub your eyes,
Believe!</p>

<p><i>Cesario (musing).</i> It has been long.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i>                            As tapestry
Pricked out by women's needles; point-device
As saints in fitted haloes. Yet they stab,
Those needles. Oh, the devil take their tongues!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Why, what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> P'st! another lie
Against the Countess Fulvia; and the train
Laid to my sister's ear. Cesario,
My sister is a saint&mdash;and yet she married:
Therefore should understand ... Would saints, like cobblers,
Stick but to business in this naughty world!
Ah, well! the Duke comes home.</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> And what of that?</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Release!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Release?</p>

<p><i>Lucio (mocking a chant within the Chapel).</i> From priests and petticoats
Deliver us, Good Lord!</p>

<p><i>Gamba (strikes a chord on viol). AMEN!</i></p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Count Lucio,
These seven years agone, when the Duke sailed,
You were a child&mdash;a pretty, forward boy;
And I a young lieutenant of the Guard,
Burning to serve abroad. But that day, rather,
I clenched my nails over an inward wound:
For that a something manlier than my years&mdash;
Look, bearing, what-not&mdash;by the Duke not miss'd,
Condemned me to promotion: I must bide
At home, command the Guard! 'Tis an old hurt,
But scalded on my memory.... Well, they sailed!
And from the terrace here, sick with self-pity,
Wrapped in my wrong, forgetful of devoir,
I watch'd them through a mist&mdash;turned with a sob&mdash;
Uptore my rooted sight&mdash;
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 6.25em;">There, there she stood;</span><br />
Her hand press'd to her girdle, where the babe
Stirred in her body while she gazed&mdash;she gazed&mdash;
But slowly back controlled her eyes, met mine;
So&mdash;with how wan, how small, how brave a smile!&mdash;
Reached me her hands to kiss ...
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 8em;">O royal hands!</span><br />
What burdens since they have borne let Adria tell.
But hear me swear by them, Count Lucio&mdash;
Who slights our Regent throws his glove to me.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Why, soothly, she's my sister!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> 'But the court
Is dull? No masques, few banquetings&mdash;and prayers
Be long, and youth for pastime leaps the gate?'
Yet if the money husbanded on feasts
Have fed our soldiery against the Turk,
Year after year, and still the State not starved;
Was't not well done? And if, responsible
To God, and lonely, she has leaned on God
Too heavily for our patience, was't not wise?&mdash;
And well, though weary?</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> I tell you, she's my sister!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Well, an you will, bridle on that. Lord Lucio,
You named the Countess Fulvia. To my sorrow,
Two hours ago I called on her and laid her
Under arrest.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> The devil! For what?</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> For that
A lady, whose lord keeps summer in the hills
To nurse a gouty foot, should penalize
His dutiful return by shutting doors
And hanging out a ladder made of rope,
Or prove its safety by rehearsing it
Upon a heavier man.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> I'll go to her.
Oh, this is infamous!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Nay, be advised:
No hardship irks the lady, save to sit
At home and feed her sparrows; nor no worse
Annoy than from her balcony to spy
(Should the eye rove) a Switzer of the Guard
At post between her raspberry-canes, to watch
And fright the thrushes from forbidden fruit.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Infamous! infamous!</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Enough, my lord:
The Regent!</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>Doors of the Chapel open. The organ sounds,
with voices of choir chanting the recessional.
The Court enters from Mass, attending the
Regent Ottilia and her son Tonino. She wears
a crown and heavy dalmatic. Her brother
Lucio, controlling himself with an effort, kisses
her hand and conducts her to the marble bench,
which serves for her Chair of State. She bows,
receiving the homage of the crowd; but, after
seating herself, appears for a few moments unconscious
of her surroundings. Then, as her
rosary slips from her fingers and falls heavily
at her feet, she speaks.</i></p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> So slips the chain linking this world with Heaven,
And drops me back to earth: so slips the chain
That hangs my spirit to the Redeemer's cross
Above pollution in the pure swept air
Whereunder frets this hive: so slips the chain&mdash;
<i>(She starts up)</i>&mdash;God! the dear sound! Was that his anchor dropped?
Speak to the watchman, one! Call to the watch!
What news?</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Aloft! What news?</p>

<p><i>Voice above.</i> No sail as yet!</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Ah, pardon, sirs! My ears are strung to-day,
And play false airs invented by the wind.
Methought a hawse-pipe rattled ...</p>

<p><i>Gamba (chants to his viol). Shepherds, see&mdash;
Lo! What a mariner love hath made me!</i></p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> What chants the Fool?</p>

<p><i>Gamba.</i> Madonna, 'tis a trifle
Made by a silly poet on wives that stand
All night at windows listening the surf&mdash;
<i>Now he comes! Will he come? Alas! no, no!</i></p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Peace, lively! Madam, there is news&mdash;brave news!
I'm from the watch-house. There the pilots tell
Of sixteen sail to the southward! Sixteen sail,
And nearing fast!</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Praise God! dear Lucio!</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>She has seated herself again. She takes Lucio's
hand and speaks, petting it.</i></p>
<br />

<p>What?  Glowing with my happiness?  That's like you.
But for yourself the hour, too, holds release.</p>

<p><i>Lucio (between sullenness and shame, with a glance at
Cesario).</i> &quot;Release?&quot;</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i>          You will forgive? I have great need
To be forgiven: sadly I have been slack
In guardianship, and by so much betrayed
My promise to our mother's passing soul.
Myself in cares immersed, I left the child
Among his toys&mdash;and turn to find him man&mdash;
But yet so much a boy that boyhood can
<i>(Wistfully)</i> Laugh in his honest eyes? Forgive me, Lucio!
Tell me, whate'er have slackened, there has slipped
No knot of love. To-morrow we'll make sport,
Be playmates and invent new games, and old&mdash;
Wreath flowers for crowns&mdash;</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>He drags his hand away. She gazes at him
wistfully, and turns to the Captain of the
Guard.</i></p>

<p>
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 7.5em;">Cesario,</span><br />
What are the suits?</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i>        They are but three to-day,
Madonna. First, a scoundrel here in irons
For having struck the Guard.</p>

<p><i>Regent (eying the culprit).</i>            His name, I think,
Is Donatello Crocco. Hey? You improve,
Good man. The last time 'twas your wife you basted.
At this rate, in another year or two
You'll bang the Turk. Do you confess the assault?</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> I do.</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Upon a promise we dismiss you.
Your tavern, as it comes into our mind,
Is the 'Three Cups.' So many, and no more,
You'll drink to-day&mdash;have we your word? Three cups,
And each a <i>Viva</i> for the Duke's return.</p>

<p><i>Prisoner.</i> Your Highness, I'll not take it at the price
Of my good manners. I'm a gallant man:
And who in Adria calls. 'Three cheers for the Duke!'
But adds a fourth for the Duchess? Lady, nay;
Grant me that fourth, or back I go to the cells!</p>
<br />

<p>[<i>The Regent laughs and nods to the Guard to release
him.</i></p>
<br />

<p><i>Regent.</i> What next?</p>

<p><i>An Old Woman (very rapidly).</i> Your Highness will not know me&mdash;Zia
Agnese, Giovannucci's wife that was;
And feed a two-three cows, as a widow may,
On the marshes where the grass is salt and sweet
As your Highness knows&mdash;and always true to pail
Until this Nicolo&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Nicolo.</i> Lies! lies, your Highness!</p>

<p><i>Old Woman.</i> Having a quarrel, puts the evil eye
On Serafina. She's my best of cows,
In stall with calf but ten days weaned.</p>

<p><i>Nicolo.</i> Lies! lies!</p>

<p><i>Old Woman.</i> I would your Highness saw her! When that thief
Hangs upon Lazarus' bosom, he'll be bidding
A ducat for each drop of milk he's cost me,
To cool his tongue.</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Ay&mdash;ay, the cow is sick,
I think; and mind me, being country-bred,
Of a cure for such: which is, to buy a comb
And comb the sufferer's tail at feeding-time.
If Zia Agnese do but this, she'll counter
The Evil Eye, and maybe with her own
Detect who thieves her Serafina's hay.</p>

<p><i>Old Woman.</i> God bless your Highness!</p>

<p><i>Nicolo.</i> God bless your Highness!</p>

<p><i>Regent (taking up a fresh suit).</i>Why, what's here? &quot;<i>Costanza,
Wife of Giuseppe Boni, citeth him
And sueth to live separate, for neglect
And divers beatings, as to wit----</i>&quot; H'm, h'm&mdash;
<i>Likewise to keep the child Geronimo,
Begotten of his body.</i> You defend
The suit, Giuseppe?</p>

<p><i>A Young Peasant (shrugs his shoulders).</i> As the woman will!
I'll not deny I beat her.</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> But neglect!
How came you to neglect her? Look on her&mdash;
The handsome, frowsy slut, that, by appearance,
Hath never washed her body since she wed.
A beating we might pass. But how neglect
To take her by the neck unto the pump
And hold her till her wet and furious face
Were once again worth kissing? Well&mdash;well&mdash;well!
Neglect is proven. She shall have deserts:
<i>(To a Clerk)</i> But&mdash;write, &quot;Defendant keeps his lawful child.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Young Peasant.</i> My lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> Nay, my lady&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Eh? What's this?</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> The poor <i>bambino</i>! Nay, 'twas not the suit!
How should Giuseppe, being a fool, a man&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Young Peasant.</i> Aye, aye: that's sense. I love him: still, you see&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> An if my judgment suit you not, go home,
The pair. <i>(As they are going she calls the woman back.)</i>
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 2.25em;">Costanza! hath your husband erred</span><br />
With other woman?</p>

<p><i>Young Peasant</i>.    Never!</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.                    I'll not charge him
With that.</p>

<p><i>Regent</i>.    But, yes, you may. This man hath held
Another woman to his breast.</p>

<p><i>Wife</i>.                        Her name?
That I may tear her eyes!</p>

<p><i>Regent</i>.                   Her name's Costanza.
The same Costanza that, with body washed,
With ribbon in her hair, light in her eyes,
Arrayed a cottage to allure his heart.
Go home, poor fools, and find her!...
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 2.5em;">Heigh! No others?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>Heaves a sigh.</i></span><br />
Captain, dismiss the Guard. The watch, aloft&mdash;
Set him elsewhere. We would not be o'erlooked.
You only, Lucio&mdash;you, Lucetta&mdash;stay;
You for a while, Cesario.</p>

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 4em;">[<i>Exeunt Courtiers, Guard, Crowd, etc.</i></span><br />

<p>Heigh! that's over&mdash;
The last Court of the Regent; and the books
Accounts of stewardship, my seven years all,
Closed here for audit.
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 3.75em;">Nay, there's one thing more&mdash;</span><br />
Brother, erewhile I spoke you sisterly,
You turned away, and still you bite your lip:
Signs that may short my preface. It concerns
The Countess Fulvia.</p>

<p><i>Lucio</i>. Ha!</p>

<p><i>Regent</i>. Go, bring her, Captain.</p>

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 8.75em;">[<i>Exit Cesario</i>.</span><br />

<p>List to me, Lucio: listen, brother dear,
First playmate-child, tending whose innocence
Myself learned motherhood. Shall I deny
Youth to be loved and follow after love?
There is a love breaks like a morning beam
On the husht novice kneeling by his arms;
And worse there is, whose kisses strangle love,
Whose feet take hold of hell. My Lucio,
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Follow not that!</span>
</p>
<p><i>Lucio</i>. Why, who&mdash;who hath maligned
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">The Countess?</span>
</p>

<p><i>Regent</i> Not maligned. Lucetta, here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lucio</i>. Lucetta! Curse Lucetta and her tongue!
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Am I a child, to be nagged by waiting-maids?</span>
</p>


<p><i>Regent</i>. No, but a man, and shall weigh evidence.</p>

<p><i>Lucio</i>. But I'll not hear it! If her viper tongue
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Can kill, why kill it must. But send me a man,</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">And I will smite his mouth&mdash;ay, slit his tongue&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">That dares defame the Countess!</span>
</p>


<p><i>Regent</i>. Stay: she comes.</p>
<p>
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 2.75em;">[<i>Enter the Countess Fulvia, Cesario attending.</i></span><br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Madam, the reason wherefore you are summoned</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">No doubt you guess, from a rude earlier call</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Our Captain paid you. Certain practices,</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Which you may force me name, are charged upon</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 2.25em;">you</span><br />
On testimony you may force me call
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">And may with freedom question.</span>
</p>
<p><i>Fulvia</i>. I'll not question:
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">No, nor I will not answer.</span>
</p>


<p><i>Lucio</i>. Then I'll answer!'
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">For me, for all, she is innocent!</span>
</p>


<p><i>Regent</i>. For you?
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">We'll hope it: but 'for all' 's more wide an oath</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Than you can swear, sir. I'll not bandy you</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Words nor debate. Myself the ladder saw;</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Lucetta, here, the ladder and the man.</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;"><i>What</i> man she will not say. Cesario</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Has tracked his footprint on her garden plots.</span><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Must we say more?</span>
</p>


<p><i>Fulvia</i>. No need. Her fingering mind
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">Is a close cupboard turning all things rancid.</span>
</p>


<p><i>Lucio</i>. Yea, for such wry-necks all the world's a lawn
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1em;">To peek and peer and pounce a sinful worm;</span><br />

Where in a heap beneath a broken flag
Lay Adria.&mdash;

Till thou hast drunk a shudder of this wretch,

Dear, bring him: he was here awhile and held me.
Say he must hold, or the light air will lift
And bear me quite away.</p>

<p>[<i>Re-enter Cesario. In one hand he carries his
sword, in the other a dagger.</i></p>

What! Is that devil escaped? To think&mdash;to think
I drank her kisses!&mdash;What? Where is she?</p>

<p><i>Cesario.</i> Dead.
I raised the cry: the people pointed after;
Ran with me, ravening. Just this side the bridge
She heard our howl and turned&mdash;drew back the dagger
Red with our lady's blood, then drove it home
Clean to her own black heart.</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i>   God pardon her!
I would what blood of mine clung to the blade
Might mix with hers and sweeten it for mercy.</p>

<p><i>Lucio.</i> Will you forgive her? Then forgive not me!</p>

<p><i>Regent.</i> Dear Lucio!&mdash;You'll not pluck away your hand
This time? Hush! Where's Cesario?... Friend, farewell.

I am so tired&mdash;so tired! Love, let me play!

<p>[<i>The Courtiers lift the body in silence and bear it
to the Chapel, the Duke and his train following.
The doors close on them. On the stage are
left only Cesario, standing by the balustrade;
and Gamba, who has seated himself with his
viol and touches it, as still the voice sings
below&mdash;</i></p>

a cry the Fool flings himself, heart-broken, on
the empty couch. Cesario steps forward and

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.75em;">Love shuts the door on the lamp and our two selves:</span>

Not my stirring awakened the flame that behind her<br />

<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">Veterans are my books, with tarnished gilding:</span><br /><br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">Where is her laughter now? Old tarnished covers&mdash;</span><br /><br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.75em;">Time, chance, brought us together, and these estranged.</span><br /><br />
Loyal were we to the mood of the moment granted,<br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">Passion&mdash;wisdom&mdash;fell back like a fence enchanted,</span><br /><br />

<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.25em;">Look past the woman you love. On wall and ceiling</span><br /><br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 1.75em;">Climbs not a trellis of roses&mdash;and ghosts&mdash;of yore?</span>

<p>Nay, more than violets<br />
These thoughts of thine, friend!<br />
Rather thy reedy brook&mdash;<br />
Taw's tributary&mdash;<br />
At midnight murmuring,<br />
Descried them, the delicate<br />
Dark-eyed goddesses,<br />
There by his cressy bed<br />
Dissolved and dreaming<br />
Dreams that distilled into dew<br />
All the purple of night,<br />
All the shine of a planet.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Whereat he whispered;<br />
And they arising&mdash;</p><br />
<br />
<p>Of day's forget-me-nots<br />
The duskier sisters&mdash;<br />
Descended, relinquished<br />
The orchard, the trout-pool,<br />
Torridge and Tamar,<br />
The Druid circles,<br />
Sheepfolds of Dartmoor,<br />
Granite and sandstone;<br />
By Roughtor, Dozmare,<br />
Down the vale of the Fowey<br />
Moving in silence,<br />
Brushing the nightshade<br />
By bridges cyclopean,<br />
By Trevenna, Treverbyn,<br />
Lawharne and Largin,<br />
By Glynn, Lanhydrock,<br />
Restormel, Lostwithiel,<br />
Dark wood, dim water, dreaming town;<br />
Down the vale of the Fowey<br />
To the tidal water<br />
Washing the feet<br />
Of fair St Winnow&mdash;<br />
Each, in her exile<br />
Musing the message,<br />
Passed, as the starlit<br />
Shadow of Ruth from the land of the Moabite.</p><br />
<br />
<p>So they came,<br />
Valley-born, valley-nurtured&mdash;<br />
Came to the tideway<br />
The jetties, the anchorage,<br />
The salt wind piping,<br />
Snoring in Equinox,<br />
By ships at anchor,<br />
By quays tormented,<br />
Storm-bitten streets;<br />
Came to the Haven<br />
Crying, &quot;Ah, shelter us,<br />
The strayed ambassadors,<br />
Love's lost legation<br />
On a comfortless coast!&quot;</p><br />
<br />
<p>Nay, but a little sleep,<br />
A little folding<br />
Of petals to the lull<br />
Of quiet rainfalls&mdash;<br />
Here in my garden,<br />
In angle sheltered<br />
From north and east wind&mdash;<br />
Softly shall recreate<br />
The courage of charity,<br />
Henceforth not to me only<br />
Breathing the message.</p><br />
<br />
<p>Clean-breath'd Sirens!<br />
Hencefore the mariner<br />
Here in the fairway<br />
Fetching&mdash;foul of keel,<br />
Long-stray but fortunate&mdash;<br />
Out of the fogs, the vast<br />
Atlantic solitudes.<br />
Shall, by the hawser-pin<br />
Waiting the signal<br />

Scent the familiar,<br />
The unforgettable<br />

A CHAPLET OF VERSE</p>
<p>You and I and Burd so blithe&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Burd so blithe, and you, and I&mdash;</span><br /><br />
The Mower he would whet his scythe<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Before the dew was dry.</span>
</p>
<p>
And he woke soon, but we woke soon<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And drew the nursery blind,</span><br /><br />
All wondering at the waning moon<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With the small June roses twined:</span><br /><br />
Low in her cradle swung the moon<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With an elfin dawn behind.</span>
</p>
<p>
In whispers, while our elders slept,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">We knelt and said our prayers,</span><br /><br />
And dress'd us and on tiptoe crept<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Adown the creaking stairs.</span>
</p>
<p>
The world's possessors lay abed,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And all the world was ours&mdash;</span><br /><br />
&quot;Nay, nay, but hark! the Mower's tread!<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And we must save the flowers!&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
The Mower knew not rest nor haste&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That old unweary man:</span><br /><br />
But we were young. We paused and raced<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And gather'd while we ran.</span>
</p>
<p>
O youth is careless, youth is fleet,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With heart and wing of bird!</span><br /><br />
The lark flew up beneath our feet,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">To his copse the pheasant whirr'd;</span>
</p>
<p>
The cattle from their darkling lairs<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Heaved up and stretch'd themselves;</span><br /><br />
Almost they trod at unawares<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Upon the busy elves</span>
</p>
<p>
That dropp'd their spools of gossamer,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">To dangle and to dry,</span><br /><br />
And scurried home to the hollow fir<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the white owl winks an eye.</span>
</p>
<p>
Nor you, nor I, nor Burd so blithe<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Had driven them in this haste;</span><br /><br />
But the old, old man, so lean and lithe,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That afar behind us paced;</span><br /><br />
So lean and lithe, with shoulder'd scythe,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And a whetstone at his waist.</span>
</p>
<p>
Within the gate, in a grassy round<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Whence they had earliest flown,</span><br /><br />
He upside-down'd his scythe, and ground<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Its edge with careful hone.</span><br /><br />
But we heeded not, if we heard, the sound,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">For the world was ours alone;</span><br /><br />
The world was ours!&mdash;and with a bound<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The conquering Sun upshone!</span>
</p>
<p>
And while as from his level ray<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">We stood our eyes to screen.</span><br /><br />
The world was not as yesterday<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Our homelier world had been&mdash;</span><br /><br />
So grey and golden-green it lay<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">All in his quiet sheen,</span><br /><br />
That wove the gold into the grey,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The grey into the green.</span><br /><br />
Sure never hand of Puck, nor wand<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Of Mab the fairies' queen,</span><br /><br />
Nor prince nor peer of fairyland<br />
Had power to weave that wide riband<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Of the grey, the gold, the green.</span>
</p>
<p>
But the Gods of Greece had been before<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And walked our meads along,</span><br /><br />
The great authentic Gods of yore<br />
That haunt the earth from shore to shore<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Trailing their robes of song.</span>
</p>
<p>
And where a sandall'd foot had brush'd,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And where a scarfed hem,</span><br /><br />
The flowers awoke from sleep and rush'd<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Like children after them.</span>
</p>
<p>
Pell-mell they poured by vale and stream,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">By lawn and steepy brae&mdash;</span><br /><br />
&quot;O children, children! while you dream,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Your flowers run all away!&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
But afar and abed and sleepily<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The children heard us call;</span><br /><br />
And Burd so blithe and you and I<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Must be gatherers for all.</span>
</p>
<p>
The meadow-sweet beside the hedge,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The dog-rose and the vetch,</span><br /><br />
The sworded iris 'mid the sedge,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The mallow by the ditch&mdash;</span>
</p>
<p>
With these, and by the wimpling burn,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Where the midges danced in reels,</span><br /><br />
With the watermint and the lady fern<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">We brimm'd out wicker creels:</span>
</p>
<p>
Till, all so heavily they weigh'd,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">On a bank we flung us down,</span><br /><br />
Shook out our treasures 'neath the shade<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And wove this Triple Crown.</span>
</p>
<p>
Flower after flower&mdash;for some there were<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The noonday heats had dried,</span><br /><br />
And some were dear yet could not bear<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">A lovelier cheek beside,</span><br /><br />
And some were perfect past compare&mdash;<br />
Ah, darlings! what a world of care<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">It cost us to decide!</span>
</p>
<p>
Natheless we sang in sweet accord,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Each bending o'er her brede&mdash;</span><br /><br />
&quot;O there be flowers in Oxenford,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And flowers be north of Tweed,</span><br /><br />
And flowers there be on earthly sward<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That owe no mortal seed!&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
And these, the brightest that we wove,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Were Innocence and Truth,</span><br /><br />
And holy Peace and angel Love,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Glad Hope and gentle Ruth.</span><br /><br />
Ah, bind them fast with triple twine<br />
Of Memory, the wild woodbine<br />
That still, being human, stays divine,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And alone is age's youth!...</span>
</p>
<p>
But hark! but look! the warning rook<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Wings home in level flight;</span><br /><br />
The children tired with play and book<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Have kiss'd and call'd Good-night!</span>
</p>
<p>
Ah, sisters, look! What fields be these<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That lie so sad and shorn?</span><br /><br />
What hand has cut our coppices,<br />
And thro' the trimm'd, the ruin'd, trees<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Lets wail a wind forlorn?</span>
</p>
<p>
'Tis Time, 'tis Time has done this crime<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And laid our meadows waste&mdash;</span><br /><br />
The bent unwearied tyrant Time,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That knows nor rest nor haste.</span>
</p>
<p>
Yet courage, children; homeward bring<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Your hearts, your garlands high;</span><br /><br />
For we have dared to do a thing<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That shall his worst defy.</span>
</p>
<p>
We cannot nail the dial's hand;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">We cannot bind the sun</span><br /><br />
By Gibeon to stay and stand,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Or the moon o'er Ajalon;</span>
</p>
<p>
We cannot blunt th' abhorred shears,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor shift the skeins of Fate,</span><br /><br />
Nor say unto the posting years<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">&quot;Ye shall not desolate.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>
We cannot cage the lion's rage,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Nor teach the turtle-dove</span><br /><br />
Beside what well his moan to tell<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Or to haunt one only grove;</span><br /><br />
But the lion's brood will range for food<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">As the fledged bird will rove.</span>
</p>
<p>
And east and west we three may wend&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet we a wreath have wound</span><br /><br />
For us shall wind withouten end<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The wide, wide world around:</span>
</p>
<p>
Be it east or west, and ne'er so far,<br />
In east or west shall peep no star,<br />
No blossom break from ground,<br />
But minds us of the wreath we wove<br />
Of innocence and holy love<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That in the meads we found,</span><br /><br />
And handsell'd from the Mower's scythe,<br />
And bound with memory's living withe&mdash;<br />
You and I and Burd so blithe&mdash;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Three maidens on a mound:</span><br /><br />
And all of happiness was ours<br />
Shall find remembrance 'mid the flowers,<br />
Shall take revival from the flowers<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And by the flowers be crown'd.</span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
